## Interests

My main interests, apart from anything game or computer related stuff, are sports, in particular ü•ä Kickboxing and weight lifting. 

I also enjoy playing ‚ôüÔ∏èchess a lot to unwind, and I read a lot of technical and non-technical books in my free time.

## Maya

I am also proudly owned by my cat Maya. Here is an obligatory gallery of her:

Yes, she enjoys being dangerously close to precarious positions where she might fall, I have no control over this.
