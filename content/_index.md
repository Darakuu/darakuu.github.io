### Professional Experience

---


I am a C++ Unreal Engine 5 Game Developer at [Bevium](https://bevium.it/). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science.

My experience with Unreal Engine covers a wide territory. I have mostly focused on AI development using behavior trees, building customizable build workflows via UBT/UAT for faster iteration, C++ gameplay programming, and level design, from initial blockouts to finalized visuals. 

A showcase of my work is available on my [Projects](/projects) page.

A brief timeline of my professional experience is available on my [Resume](/resume) page.

### Game Development Passion

---

For over a decade, I have also been modding Source Engine games, like Half-Life 2, Garry's Mod, or Black Mesa. My main passion has been creating custom maps with the Hammer editor, but I have also dabbled in small custom mods with the Source SDK.

I am very passionate about Game Development and Design, willing to innovate and explore creative solutions to make awesome games, unrestricted by boring standards.
